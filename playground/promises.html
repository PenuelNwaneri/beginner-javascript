//That is useful because let's say we wanted to make multiple pizzas one after the other, and we have an oven that can only cook one at at time.

// Delete our canadianPizza and pepperoniPizza declaration code and everything below it in the script tag and just leave the line below

// We can chain a .then() immediately onto it (because makePizza returns a promise), which gives a function that has a pizza. LLog the pizza so that we know that it still works.

//The neat thing is if from this then() we return another makePizza, you can then chain another .then() on that function.

//Unlike what we were doing the lesson where we were adding and removing classes which were all nested in callback hell, this chaining of then is the promise land and it allows us to keep all of our logic one level deep.

// We will look at how we can use async/await to get around that.

 **/
//When we refresh the page and the above code is executed, what should happen is ham and cheese should be logged to the console faster than the pizza with 3 toppings.

// Let's chain 2 more pizzas together, one with no toppings, the other with a lot of toppings. Then let's resolve that last pizza and just log it using an arrow function as shown above.

//Promise.all()

//Let's say we have a big oven and we can make all the pizzas at once. You could run them all concurrently, instead of one after another like we are doing (which is referred to as sequentially).

//If you have 10 employees and an oven big enough to cook them all at once, you can do it like so 👇

// Run them Concurrently
  /**const pizzaPromise1 = makePizza(['hot peppers', 'onion', 'feta']);
  const pizzaPromise2 = makePizza(['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four']);
  const pizzaPromise3 = makePizza(['ham', 'cheese']);
**/
// So how do we know when all of those promises are done? We could do .then() on each of them like so 👇
/**
pizzaPromise1.then(pizza => {
  console.log(pizza)
})
pizzaPromise2.then(pizza => {
  console.log(pizza)
})
pizzaPromise3.then(pizza => {
  console.log(pizza)
})
**/

// But those are going to pop into the console in whatever order they are done, which isn't what we want. We can instead make it into a "mega promise" that we then wait upon.

// If you have a few promises and all you care about is when all 3 of them are finished, you can make a mega promises, which we will call a dinnerPromise.
/**
const dinnerPromise = Promise.all([pizzaPromise1, pizzaPromise2, pizzaPromise3]);
**/
// Promise.all() is a static method because it lives on the "momma" Promise directly.

// It takes an array of "baby" promises which are pizza1, pizza2, pizza3.

 // That makes one big promise which then you can call .then() on and we get passed the pizzas which we will log.

/**dinnerPromise.then(pizzas => {
  console.log(pizzas);
})**/

//Now we wait for all 3 to be finished, and we get an array of all 3 of them

// If you wanted the first pizza it would be pizza[0].

// A pretty common thing to do is destructure the pizzas.

// Let's convert the arrow function to a regular function to make it clearer to understand.

// We will use array destructuring. Let's call the first pizza hottie, second one garbagePail and third one hamAndCheese.

// Those will now be equal to 3 variables which we can now log or use however we want like so 👇

/**
dinnerPromise.then(function (pizzas) {
  [hottie, garbagePail, hamAndCheese] = pizzas;
  console.log(hottie, garbagePail, hamAndCheese);
}); 
**/
//You do not have to destructure those variables in the body of the function, you can destructure the argument directly with square brackets.
/**
dinnerPromise.then(function ([hottie, garbagePail, hamAndCheese]) {
  console.log(hottie, garbagePail, hamAndCheese);
});
**/
// That is saying take the first argument and destructure it into a variable named hottie , the second one into garbagePail and so on.

// If you refresh the page you will see it still works.

// To reiterate, Promise.all() will take all of your promises and will only resolve when all 3 of the sub-promises have been resolved themselves.


// Promise.race()
//Similarly there is Promise.race(). Let's say someone is really hungry and they will take whichever pizza the first pizza is that is ready because they are very hungry.

// We could do this 👇
/**
const firstPizzaPromise = Promise.race([pizzaPromise1, pizzaPromise2, pizzaPromise3]);

firstPizzaPromise.then(pizza => {
  console.log('You must be hungry, here is the first one ready');
  console.log(pizza);
})
**/
//TO reiterate, Promise.race() will wait for the first one to finish rendering.

//There are also a couple of other ones which we will get into when we talk about error handling.

// That is a high level overview of promises.


/**
Promises - Error Handling
In this lesson we will talk about the opposite of resolving, which is rejecting.

When a promise goes awry, and you want to bail on it, you can call the reject function.

Let's go back to our makePizza definition and inside of our promise we need to check whether one of the toppings chosen for the pizza is pineapple.

If it is true, we need to reject the pizza from happening.

For now will only check for lowercase "pineapple" but we will have to try to weed out people who uppercase it as well later. If that condition is met, then we will call reject and pass it "seriously? get out".

To do that we will add the code below.

if(toppings.includes('pineapple')){
  reject("Seriously? Get out 🍍");
}
**/

const makePizza = (toppings =[]) => {
  return new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
    // reject if people try with pineapple
if (toppings.includes('pineapple')) {
          reject('Seriously? Get out 🍍');
        }
    //wait 1 seconds for the pizza to cook
const amountOfTimeToBake = 500 + (toppings.length * 200);
   setTimeout(() => {resolve(`Here is your pizza 🍕 with the toppings ${toppings.join(' ')}`);
  },amountOfTimeToBake);
     //if something went wrong, we can reject this promise
  });
}


//console.log('first')
makePizza(['pepperoni','ham']).then((pizza) => {
  console.log(pizza)
  return makePizza(['ham','cheese']);
}).then((pizza) => {
    console.log(pizza)
    return makePizza(['hot peppers','onions','feta'])
  }).then((pizza) => {
    console.log(pizza)
    return makePizza(['pineapple'])
  }).then((pizza) => {
    console.log(pizza)
    return makePizza()
  }).then((pizza) => {
    console.log(pizza)
    return makePizza(['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four']);
  }).then((pizza) => {
    console.log('All done! here is your last pizza');
      console.log(pizza)
    }).catch(handleError)
  //console.log('right After')
  
  //Now let's go to the top of the script section and comment out the code we added in the previous lesson when we were doing an example on how to run promises concurrently.

//Below that commented out code add the following 👇
function handleError(err){
  console.log('Oh noooo!');
  console.log(err);
}
makePizza(['cheese','pineapple']).then(pizza=>{
  console.log(pizza);
}).catch(handleError)

// What does that log "Uncaught (in promise)" mean?

// It means that there was an error in one of our promises, but we did not write any code in order to handle that error and try to catch it.

// The way you catch an error in a promise is you chain a .catch() to it.

// Catch will pass you the error as a parameter which we will use to log the error as shown above.

// As you see, we no longer get an error logged because we caught and logged the error ourselves.


//.then() will only run when the promise resolves successfully, and the catch will only run if the promise doesn't go successfully.

//:Almost always with your promise built functions you must chain a .then() and a .catch() at the end so that if anything goes wrong, you are able to catch it and display it to the user.

// What Wes will usually do is make a function called handleError which will take in the error and log it like so 👇
/**
function handleError(err){
  console.log('Oh noooo!');
  console.log(err);
}
**/

//Now instead of catching the error using the code we had before we can simply replace it as shown above  👆
/**
makePizza(['cheese','pineapple']).then(pizza=>{
  console.log(pizza);
}).catch(handleError);
**/


//In the code above we are passing the reference to the function which will then handle the error.



// It's important to note that not every single promise needs a catch on the end.

// Go back to our pizzas where we chained a bunch of promises together and modify the pizza with no toppings to instead pass the topping of "pineapple",


// What happens there is we go through the chain of promises and then as soon as we hit the code where we try to make a pizza with a pineapple we get the "uncaught in promise" error.


// So how do we catch the error?

// Does it mean we have to add a catch after each then? That would be annoying. Thankfully, the answer is no.

// you just need to put one catch at the very end that will be able to handle our error.


// The thing about an error happening in a promise chain is that where the error happens, it will then bail out of executing the rest of the promise chain.

// If you have 7 or 8 steps in the promise chain and they are all dependent on one another, then that is good because if step 3 in the breaks, you don't want to continue to step 4.

// But sometimes you want to continue even if one of the promises fails. If that is the case, then promise chaining is not what you want to use. Instead, you'd want to use some of the other Promise static methods like Promise.all() or Promise.race().

// Let's do an example. We will start with 2 pizzas.

const p1 = makePizza(['pep']);
const p2 = makePizza(['pineapple']);


// Promise.allSettled()

// We will use a new API that we haven't learned yet called Promise.allSettled().

// Let's start by making a mega promise.

const dinnerPromise2 = Promise.allSettled([p1, p2]);

// Let's just get the results and log them for now.
dinnerPromise2.then(results=> {
  console.log(results)
})


// As you can see in our results we can see that the first one was fulfilled and the second one was rejected. Fulfilled is another word they use for resolved.

// If we tried that example but with Promise.all() like so, you will see that the code will break.

const dinnerPromise2 = Promise.all([p1, p2]);
