// If you refresh the page, you will see in the console that we get our promise immediately and then 5 seconds after we actually have access to our pizza.


// That is a great example of how we sometimes have to wait.

// Often what you will see is instead of making a promise and then returning it, people will often just return the promise immediately.

const makePizza = (toppings) => {
  return new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
    //wait 5 seconds for the pizza to cook
   setTimeout(() => {resolve(`Here is your pizza 🍕 with the toppings ${toppings.join(' ')}`);
  },5000);
     //if something went wrong, we can reject this promise
  });
}

// The logic to how a Promise gets resolved is always inside of the Promise body, which in the example is the code below

/**function(resolve, reject){
    //wait 1 second for the pizza to cook
    setTimeout(function(){
      resolve(`Here is your pizza 🍕 with the toppings ${toppings.join(' ')}`);
    }, 1000)
    //if something went wrong, we can reject this promise
  }
  **/
  //That function will resolve or reject whenever it feels ready. In our case, we feel like the pizza is ready after one second.

//So what is happening here is when we declare our pepperoniPromise we can call makePizza(['pepperoni']), which returns a promise of pizza. In order to get the pizza, the way we can access the resolved value is by chaining a .then onto it.
/**const pepperoniPromise = makePizza(['pepperoni']);
const canadianPromise = makePizza(['pepperoni','mushroom', 'onions'])

console.log('starting')
pepperoniPromise.then((pizza)=>{
  console.log('Ah i got it')
  console.log(pizza)
  el.textContent = pizza;
})
console.log('finishing')
**/
//We will look at how we can use async/await to actually do that sequentially if we would like to, but for now we know we can chain a .then() onto it.

//Why is that any more useful than a regular callback?

//That is useful because let's say we wanted to make multiple pizzas one after the other, and we have an oven that can only cook one at at time.

// Delete our canadianPizza and pepperoniPizza declaration code and everything below it in the script tag and just leave the line below

// We can chain a .then() immediately onto it (because makePizza returns a promise), which gives a function that has a pizza. LLog the pizza so that we know that it still works.

//The neat thing is if from this then() we return another makePizza, you can then chain another .then() on that function.
